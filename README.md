# Playback Switch

<!--- SUMMARY --->
The Playback Switch is an assistive switch that also plays a prerecorded message up to 30 seconds long when the button is pressed. It has a diameter of 90mm and an activation force of roughly 250 grams. The switch is made entirely with commercial, off the shelf parts, with no 3D printing involved. It has a similar functionality to the BIGmack and LITTLEmack buttons. This device is intended for users of assistive switches who would benefit from or prefer additional audio feedback when using a switch.

The device is comprised of off-the-shelf electronics and 3D printed parts. The overall cost of materials is about $8 (plus $8 for component shipping).

The current version of the device (v1.0) has been built and user tested.
